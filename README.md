# Work-Day-Scheduler-SEO

In this project I created a work day scheduler.

This work day scheduler is fully fuctional and should be able to save any thing you want within the text boxes.

The text boxes are color cordinated by time the user is on the website.

Used jquery and dayjs to create time and parent functions.

Created a save button that saves the text the user will input in the appropriate time.

Created an if atatement that will color code the text boxes and add am or pm to the time text.

Created a for loop that created `div`, `button`, and ,textarea, tags.

Removed the html and used only the `for` loop to create this page.

Created an interval the updates the page every 5 seconds.
